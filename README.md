## Setting up a Systray App Properly with WinAPIs


</div>

### Description

This example shows a very simple very well documented sourcecode on how to create a systray application without the overhead of a class file filled with bugs using two simple WinAPI calls and three functions to further simplify those!

<p>I've seen several examples at PSC in VB on how to setup a systray application using a class file. I tried using that at first, but ran into the bug of NOT closing when my mouse moved away. Now I'm seeing fixes to the class file. <p>This example shows that using the WinAPI's is easier cleaner and not as buggy as the Class File counterpart available at PSC
 
### More Info
